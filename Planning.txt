emotion and energy are the two main deciding attributes
duration determines how many tasks can fit in a day
urgency determines how likely a task is to be chosen
also include optional due dates that can be put in place of urgency, 
     and a task with a due date will be more and more likely to be chosen the closer the due date is.

NOTES:
. I think for now I want to try to do this without having categories (work, reading, creative, etc)
. Some items you only do once, some items you can do an unlimited number of times, some items need to be 
	done every so often (so urgency would change based on how recently you last did it).
